Design Patterns Samples

Most of the design patterns are taken from http://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf (free PDF), https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8 (buy link), except for DI and microservice. Their sources are listed in their respective files.
marketplace.py and the directory protobuf are part of the microservice pattern, but the main point of interest for this pattern is in protobuf/recommendations.py
